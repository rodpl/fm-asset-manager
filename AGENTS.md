# Repository Guidelines

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines
Write Conventional Commit messages (`feat: add kit exporter`) so changelog generation stays predictable. Every PR should include a summary of behavior changes, links to related issues, and screenshots or terminal output for visual/CLI updates. Request review only after tests, lint, and formatting commands pass locally, and prefer small, focused PRs that introduce a single capability.
